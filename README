SeparateFullRSSFeed
===================

About
-----
`SeparateFullRSSFeed` is a plugin I created [my own blog] (http://nav-magno.be) to create a new feed type "FULLRSS".
- It always exports the last 100 posts
- It always exports the full text
- It strips out the *<!--more-->* tag

Installation
------------
	- Zip the files
	- Upload to your wordpress plugins
	- Activate the plugin
