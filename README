SeparateFullRSSFeed
===================

About
-----
`SeparateFullRSSFeed` is a plugin I created to create a new feed type "FULLRSS".
It always exports the full text of the last 100 posts.

I need this for [my own blog] (http://nav-magno.be).

Installation
------------
	- Zip the files
	- Upload to your wordpress plugins
	- Activate the plugin

Usage
-----
Activate the plugin and everything is *functional*.
